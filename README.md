# Hello-to-the-World

This is a markdown file about this repository.
The Readme.md markdown file gets special treatment from Github,
in that they will render this markdown file as HTML in the browser. Any text file with a .md file extension is a markdown file.

Markdown is kind of the opposite of Markup (more specifically, HTML). HTML uses tags like `<h1>` to denote styling. But in Markdown, the focus is equivalent of Headings by prefixing a line with up to six pound signs (for `<h1>` through `<h6>`).
